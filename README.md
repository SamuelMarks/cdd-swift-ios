# cdd-swift

Compiler driven development adaptor for [https://github.com/SamuelMarks/cdd-ctl](cdd-ctl).

## Installation

To install with Swift Package Manager, run:
```bash
swift build
```

If you prefer to work in xcode, generate a project via SPM:
```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

Note that if the xcode project complains about missing dependencies, try building the project once and see if they resolve.
